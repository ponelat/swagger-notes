** Suggestions
   - [ ] Put in a npm-shrinkwrap file, for supporting the build process in
         previous tags
   - [ ] Refactor .gitattributes to focus on text files, as apposed to
         manually setting files as binary.

** Small fixes
   - [ ] Typos in spec file https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md
         -


   - [ ] Offline use of valiadtor badge, in swagger-ui

*** Issue specific notes
**** Swagger UI #1037
       (latest: 82a89a7952af62c1cce3d1b946507051c1cd5ea8)
     - swagger-ui@2.1.0-M1 doesn't render correctly (doesn't even render the 'Array' part)
     - swagger-ui@2.1.4-M1 doesn't render correctly, does render Array part
     - swagger-ui@2.1.2-M1 doesn't render correctly, doesn't show Array part
     - latest has a preferred output in the response model rendering,
       of petstore#/pet/findPetByStatus
     - #!/user/createUsersWithArrayInput, shows incorrect behaviour in
      parameter 'Data Type': Array[#/definitions/User]

*** Reference
    - new Operation (parent, scheme, operationId, httpMethod, path, args, definitions, models, clientAuthorizations)
*** Awesome debugger of specs and -UI
    - [ ] Show -UI and -JS version
    - [ ] Allow inline specs, yaml and json
    - [ ] Allow jumping to a specific tagged version of -UI, whoa!
** Ideas
*** SwagLife - a map of the swagger eco-system
    - With elastic search into github issues and PRs
      ... or just jump to one?
    - Heavily user friendly, with floating boxes refering to repos, popups
      showing details.
    - Examples for the masses, copy-paste for quick playing around. CORs
      support for served specs.
    - Access to online tools, editor.swagger.io, codegen.swagger,
      petstore.swagger, validation, yml2json, more?
    - Shout out to community projects, share the love!
