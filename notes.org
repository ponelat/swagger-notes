* Notes
** Suggestions
- [ ] Put in a npm-shrinkwrap file, for supporting the build process in
     previous tags
- [ ] Refactor .gitattributes to focus on text files, as apposed to
     manually setting files as binary.
- [ ] Allow inline specs in swagger-ui, for testing mostly.

- [ ] Use expect.js and sinon in tests
- [ ] Why are tags and npm version out of sync/wack? for instance currently
      we're working on swagger-js@2.1.3-M1 but we have a tag for v2.1.9-M1 ??
** Small fixes
- [ ] Typos in spec file https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md
     -
- [ ] Offline use of valiadtor badge, in swagger-ui

** Ideas
*** Awesome debugger of specs and -UI
    - [ ] Show -UI and -JS version
    - [ ] Allow inline specs, yaml and json
    - [ ] Allow jumping to a specific tagged version of -UI, whoa!
    - [ ] A library of specs, uploaded like gists
*** SwagLife - a map of the swagger eco-system
    - With elastic search into github issues and PRs
      ... or just jump to one?
    - Heavily user friendly, with floating boxes refering to repos, popups
      showing details.
    - Examples for the masses, copy-paste for quick playing around. CORs
      support for served specs.
    - Access to online tools, editor.swagger.io, codegen.swagger,
      petstore.swagger, validation, yml2json, more?
    - Shout out to community projects, share the love!
    - Build it from the start on the greensock engine
*** gulp --client
    - gulp --client='file | url'

** Reference
  - new Operation (parent, scheme, operationId, httpMethod, path, args, definitions, models, clientAuthorizations)

  - Swagger specs: http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json  , http://petstore.swagger.io/api/api-docs

** PR checklist:
  - Is the issue resolved?
  - Does it have tests?
  - Have you built the files?
  - Linted them?
  - Is the issue resolved?


** How to manipulate the swagger-client from swagger-ui
   - SwaggerUI returns instance with swaggerUI#api which is an instance of
     SwaggerClient.
   - swaggerClient#build contructs from spec
** StatusCodeView...
   - SwaggerUi, new SwaggerClient -> this.api
   - ..MainView(model) model.apisArray.each -> resource
   - ..ResourceView(model) model.operationArray -> operation
   - ..OperationView(model) model.responses[code].schema
     ....if schema.$ref -> strip  -> responseMessages
   - ..StatusCodeView if api.models[strippedSchema$ref] {use api.models[...]}
** StatusCodeView, from SwaggerClient
   - #buildFromSpec(response)
   - path = response.paths.each
     operation = path[method]
     new Operation(...,operation,..)
   - /lib/types/operation.js
     operation#responses (or args.responses)
     leaves reponses alone, except for promoting 'success' response
